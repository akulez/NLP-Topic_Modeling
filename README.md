-- Project Summary: Applying Topic Modeling to BBC News Dataset

-- Step 1: Data Analysis
-- Performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset and the textual content it contained by using various descriptive statistics.
-- Used visualizations as well as word clouds to figure out most commonly used words and patterns in the occurrence of words.
-- Combined the titles and descriptions of the news articles to extract more information from the text.

-- Step 2: Text Preprocessing
-- Performed text preprocessing to clean the text and prepare it for analysis.
-- Removed stopwords, punctuation, extra spaces, and unnecessary characters that could interfere with the accuracy of the analysis.

-- Step 3: Text Vectorization using FastText and Embedding Visualizations using UMAP
-- Converted the preprocessed text into vector representations using FastText embeddings.
-- Utilized FastText embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words and generate numerical representations of the text.
-- Created Embedding Visualizations using UMAP.

-- Step 4: Topic Modeling with LDA
-- Applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, a popular topic modeling technique, to identify underlying topics within the dataset.
-- Analyzed patterns of word co-occurrence in the documents to uncover latent themes or topics.

-- Step 5: Analysis of LDA Results
-- Interpreted and understood the results obtained from the LDA model.
-- Identified the most significant terms within each topic to gain insights into the main themes present in the dataset.
