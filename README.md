Project Summary: Applying Topic Modeling to BBC News Dataset

1. **Analysis and Preprocessing**
  - Performed an in-depth analysis of the dataset and the textual content it contained by using various descriptive statistics.
  - Used visualizations as well as word clouds to figure out most commonly used words and patterns in the occurrence of words.
  - Combined the titles and descriptions of the news articles to extract more information from the text.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Performed text preprocessing to clean the text and prepare it for analysis.
  - Removed stopwords, punctuation, extra spaces, and unnecessary characters that could interfere with the accuracy of the analysis.

3. **Text Vectorization using FastText and Embedding Visualizations using UMAP:**
  - Converted the preprocessed text into vector representations using FastText embeddings.
  - Utilized FastText embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words and generate numerical representations of the text.
  - Created Embedding Visualizations using UMAP.

4. **Topic Modelling with LDA**
  - Applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm, a popular topic modeling technique, to identify underlying topics within the dataset.
  - Analyzed patterns of word co-occurrence in the documents to uncover latent themes or topics.

5. **Analysis of LDA results**
  - Interpreted and understood the results obtained from the LDA model.
  - Identified the most significant terms within each topic to gain insights into the main themes present in the dataset.
